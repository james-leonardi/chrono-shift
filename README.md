## Build Instructions
1. Download the source code and run `npm install` in the root directory.
2. Run `gulp` in the root directory. If this fails, try installing gulp manually using [this guide](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start/).
3. Host a web server on the `dist/` directory. I recommend [Simple Web Server](https://simplewebserver.org/).
4. Use a browser to connect to `localhost:8080`, or whichever port you ran the web server from.

## Premise
"Tepster Tomsper is a distinguished and capable hitman. One day while out running errands at Trader Joe's, he stumbled upon the Chrono-Switch,
a device that, when activated, allows him to travel back in time. However, when he picked up the device, it unleashed countless anomalous time clones.
Using his newfound god-like powers, he decided that it is his duty to eliminate the anachronistic fiends that are now infesting the past."
